## Materials for Library Carpentry development

Many of these materials are based on the **Library Carpentry** materials initially developed and taught by [Dr James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker), [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/ostephens) and [Daniel van Strien](https://github.com/davanstrien) in the UK.
[http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/). The original Library Carpentry contained four modules:
- Introduction, including jargon busting, data structures and regular expressions
- The Unix shell, including use of the command line and commands such as`grep` and `sed` to find data within files
- Git and version control
- Using OpenRefine for data clean up.

These four repositories have been re-developed within the GitHub `data-lessons` area, and new lessons have been added. All lessons are open to contributions, whether through pull requests or through issues raised on the repositories themselves.

## Other lessons

There is a new Data Intro lesson specifically geared towards the needs of archivists:

- [data-intro-archives](https://github.com/data-lessons/data-intro-archives)

An incubator lesson exists within a separate repository for tidying spreadsheet data:

- [library-spreadsheets](https://github.com/jezcope/library-spreadsheets0

A lot of work was done on the repositories during the recent Mozilla Global sprint. For work outstanding, please see the [issues here](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry/issues). Contributions welcome.
