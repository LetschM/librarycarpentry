## Materials for Library Carpentry development

Many of these materials are based on the **Library Carpentry** materials initially developed and taught by [Dr James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker), [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/ostephens) and [Daniel van Strien](https://github.com/davanstrien) in the UK.
[http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/). The original Library Carpentry contained four modules:
- Introduction, including jargon busting, data structures and regular expressions
- The Unix shell, including use of the command line and commands such as`grep` and `sed` to find data within files
- Git and version control
- Using OpenRefine for data clean up.

These four repositories have been re-developed within the GitHub `data-lessons` area, and new lessons have been added. All lessons are open to contributions, whether through pull requests or through issues raised on the repositories themselves.

## Lessons

Library Carpentry prides itself on reviewing and revising our lessons to ensure that they fit the needs and requirements of the communities we serve. As a result our lessons are at varying stages of maturity.

Our **Core** lessons - those which we are confident that anyone can teach with no problems - are:

- [library-data-intro](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-data-intro)
- [library-shell](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-shell)
- [library-openrefine](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-openrefine)

Our **Beta** lessons - those which need to be taught more to iron out their content and flow - are:

- [library-git](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-git)
- [library-python-intro](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-python-intro)
- [library-python](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-python)
- [library-sql](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-sql)

Our **Alpha** lessons - those which are new or substantially revised and have therefore yet to be tested in a teaching environment -  are:

- [library-webscraping](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-webscraping)
- [library-spreadsheets](https://github.com/jezcope/library-spreadsheets)
- [data-intro-archives](https://github.com/data-lessons/data-intro-archives)

If you plan to teach an **Alpha** or **Beta** status lesson at a Library Carpentry workshop, we recommend you contact the lessons maintainer (listed in the lesson README.md file) before doing so.

A lot of work was done on the repositories during the recent Mozilla Global sprint. For work outstanding, please see the [issues here](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry/issues). Contributions welcome.
