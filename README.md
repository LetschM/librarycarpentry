## Welcome librarians, archivists and other sprinters!

## The 2017 Sprint (1-2 June, 2017)
The aim of our 2017 sprint project is to extend [Library Carpentry](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/) by 
 - working on incubator lessons such as https://github.com/jezcope/library-spreadsheets
 - incorporating an existing [web scraping lesson](https://github.com/timtomch/library-webscraping) into the Library Carpentry suite
 - developing the [Python lesson](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-python/) to include these [points](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-python/issues/38)
 - bringing together various SQL lesson threads developed by different community members
 - refreshing/revising our [main web site](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/) 
 - developing a workflow for monitoring upcoming workshops and publishing our list of events in a public place
 - adapting our lesson materials to suit archivists' work practices, based on feedback from [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdc9RHNmgffnt9UtLfgIhS_MGUzh0wh-HQNX24wBz5c4mcf1g/viewform)
 - developing instructor guides for our lessons
 - hearing from the librarian/archivist community about issues they want addressed (please raise issues on each individual lesson)
 - developing examples of how the tools can be integrated into daily work, e.g. using bash scripts to automate tasks, clean up data.
 
## Participants
Anyone with an interest in Library Carpentry material is welcome to take part in the sprint. The project is being co-ordinated for the sprint by [Belinda Weaver](https://github.com/weaverbel) in Brisbane, Australia, who is also hosting [a local site for Brisbane participants](https://ti.to/Mozilla/global-sprint-brisbane). People are welcome to sign on to the project on our [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc2017) - whether to register a site, to join an existing site, or to sign on to work remotely. People are also welcome to volunteer to lead sections of work. For example, Richard Vankoningsveld will be leading the Python work and would welcome input and feedback. Sign up on the [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc2017), or express interest on the [Python lesson](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-python/) through the [Issues](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-python/issues/38) tab. 

To stay in touch during the sprint, we will use the etherpad, our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry) (sign in using your GitHub username or Twitter handle) and daily video calls - links will be posted on the [etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc2017) on each day.

## Materials for Library Carpentry development

Many of these materials are based on the **Library Carpentry** materials initially developed and taught by [Dr James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker), [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/ostephens) and [Daniel van Strien](https://github.com/davanstrien) in the UK.
[http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/). The original Library Carpentry contained four modules:
- Introduction, including jargon busting, data structures and regular expressions
- The Unix shell, including use of the command line and commands such as`grep` and `sed` to find data within files
- Git and version control
- Using OpenRefine for data clean up.

These existing four repositories were forked (links are below) and have been re-developed within individual repositories, with the addition of a fifth module that introduces **SQL**, a topic which many librarians have expressed interest in learning. 

- [library-data-intro](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-data-intro)
- [library-shell](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-shell)
- [library-git](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-git)
- [library-openrefine](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-openrefine)
- [library-sql](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-sql)

We will be creating new repositories for the sprint. Links will be provided as these repositories are added.
