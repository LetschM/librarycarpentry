## Contributing

**Library Carpentry** is an open source project. It was created initially by [Dr James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker), with 
contributions from [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/ostephens) and [Daniel van Strien](https://github.com/davanstrien), and was forked here in 2016 to facilitate further development during
the Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint, 2-3 June, 2016. Details of what we achieved in that sprint can be found in this [blog post](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/06/library-carpentry-sprint.html). The Library Carpentry community is now global, with a very active core of instructors and lesson maintainers.

We are using this fork again as the jumping-off place for work on the 2017 Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint, 
which will take place on 1-2 June, 2017. 

Details of the 2017 plan of work and the existing sites who have signed on to contribute are listed [on this etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc2017) and on the
[2017 Mozilla sprint site](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues/35). 

People can work at any of the listed sites or can contribute remotely. You do not have to commit to the full two days. 
All participation and input, however limited, is welcome. 

In this fork, we welcome contributions of all kinds: new lessons, additions to existing materials, fixes for errors, 
and bug reports. 

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under our license. In exchange, 
you will be contributing to the development of this material for the library community worldwide. 
While this is not an official Software Carpentry set of lessons or project, participants should abide by the Software
Carpentry [Code of Conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/).

See more about the initial Library Carpentry project [here](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry). 

For more up to date information, including all the work we have done since the very successful
2016 sprint, see [our main page](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/).

## What We're Looking For

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and challenge tasks to improving existing ones, 
or adapting them for different datasets. You are also welcome to point out typos, factual errors, and inconsistencies.

You do not need to be a coder to take part. Librarians are welcome to raise issues, contribute examples, ask questions, request that scenarios be addressed and so on. You can also work through the lessons and ask for clarification or further explanation or documentation.

All input is useful.

Reviews of pull requests are welcome: we want this material to be accessible and useful, so your views on
what has been added or changed will be of benefit. if you are not sure how to fix something, please raise an issue 
on the appropriate repository, and the maintainers will try to address it.

## What We're Not Looking For

We are not looking for exercises or material that can only run on 
one platform. Attendees at workshops may be Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux users. Lessons must run 
equally well on all three to be useful.

## Getting Started

If you want to start adding or editing material yourself, you may want to look at 
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github). In brief:

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the master repository.
5. If you receive feedback, make changes locally and push to your branch on GitHub: 
the pull request will update automatically.
