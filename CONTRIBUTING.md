## Contributing

**Library Carpentry** is an open source project. It was created initially by [Dr James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker), with 
contributions from [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/ostephens), and has been forked here to facilitate further development during
the Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint, 2-3 June.

See more about the initial Library Carpentry project here [here](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry).

In this fork, we welcome contributions of all kinds: new lessons, additions to existing materials, fixes for errors, 
and bug reports. 

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under our license. In exchange, 
you will be contributing to the development of this material for the library community worldwide.

## What We're Looking For

There are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and challenge tasks to improving existing ones, 
or adapting them for different datasets. You are also welcome to point out typos, factual errors, and inconsistencies.

Reviews of pull requests are welcome: we want this material to be accessible and useful, so your views on
what has been added or changed will be of benefit. if you are not sure how to fix something, please raise an issue 
and the maintainers will try to address it.

## What We're Not Looking For

We are not looking for exercises or material that can only run on 
one platform. Attendees at workshops may be Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux users. Lessons must run 
equally well on all three to be useful.

## Getting Started

If you want to start adding or editing material yourself, you may want to look at 
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github). In brief:

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the master repository.
5. If you receive feedback, make changes locally and push to your branch on GitHub: 
the pull request will update automatically.
